# Project for CSCI 5214: Big Data Architecture

## Team Buffering: Abhishek Suresh, Prajnya Satish, Rahul Aedula, Parth Anand Jawale and Soumyajyoti Bhattacharya

### This project is a web-based dashboard covering the 2019 Indian General Elections, built using modern big data technologies, various streaming APIs and twitter data for sentiment analysis.


India is the largest democracy in the world, with an electorate of almost a billion people. With a burgeoning economy and increasing access to fast internet connectivity, elections are often played out online as they are in the real world. While online dashboards to cover elections are common elsewhere, the Indian General Elections lack such a platform, and hence we chose to tackle that space by making an Indian Elections Dashboard in a scalable big data environment, utilizing robust data processing and modern NLP pipelines.
